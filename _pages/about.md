I am a PhD candidate in the <a href='https://atlarge-research.com/stalluri/'>Massivizing Computer Systems</a> group at <a href='https://vu.nl/en'>Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>. I investigate the design of cloud computing systems, particularly their resource management and fault tolerance subsystems.

I had the opportunity to be involved in a variety of research and engineering projects over my career. For my PhD, I investigated the design of datacenter schedulers, the performance of serverless triggers, and user reports of cloud failures. Due to amazing collaborators, I got to work on the Kubernetes container orchestrator, Go and JSONPath compilers, and the reliability of LLM services.
