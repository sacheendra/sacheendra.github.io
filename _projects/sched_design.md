Datacenter scheduling architectures, algorithms, and policies are well studied.  However, the APIs the schedulers expose and the component features required to build an architecture less so. My student, Aratz, and I investigated the impact of scheduler API on the performance of Google, Azure, and BitBrains workloads {% cite DBLP:conf/wosp/LasaTMI24 %}.

I investigated the feature different components, such as the scheduler, request router, and data manager, need to provide to enabled different scheduler architecture and mechanisms {%cite DBLP:journals/fgcs/TalluriHAMI24 %}.

With my colleague, Dante Niewenhuis, I investigated sustainability techniques for datacenters such {% cite DBLP:conf/wosp/NiewenhuisTIM24 %}. What size of batteries should I use? When should I run my workload?. This work is under submission.
