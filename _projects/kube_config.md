To improve Kubernetes error messages when misconfigured, I designed and implemented a dynamic dataflow analysis extension to the Go compiler. The tool is available at [https://github.com/atlarge-research/go-breadcrumbs](https://github.com/atlarge-research/go-breadcrumbs).

I helped my colleague, Matthijs Jansen, implement a tool to optimize Kubernetes's configuration to improve the deployment performance of a given workload {% cite DBLP:conf/wosp/JansenTDTIT25 %}.
