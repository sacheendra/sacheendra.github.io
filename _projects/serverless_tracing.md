With my collaborators, Joel Scheuner and Simon Eismann, I implemented a benchmar for complex serverless applications which are composed of multiple services {% cite DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2205-07696 %}.

With my student, Ritul Satish, I characterized the performance of data store trigger mechanisms used in serverless applications {% cite DBLP:conf/ccgrid/SatishTSJI25 %}.

With my student, Anders NÃµu, I investigated the performacne overhead of distributed tracing for microservices and serverless applications{% cite anou2025_tracing_overhead %} .
