I investigated the availability of cloud services and the cause of failures. I present a first-of-its-kind analysis of cloud service failures using crowdsourced data {% cite DBLP:conf/acsos/TalluriOVTI21 %}.

I followed it up with a comparative analysis of failure reports of cloud operators, web service, and online games {% cite talluri2025clouduptimearchiveopenaccess %}.

I helped my colleague, Xiaoyu Chu, investigate the failure characteristics of a medium-scale scientific datacenter during the rise of AI workloads {% cite DBLP:conf/icpads/ChuHITKPDBI24 %}. I also helped her investigate the failure characteristics of LLM service {% cite 2025-icpe-llm-service-analysis %}.
